    <p id="rosh">A paragraph is a collection of words combined together to make a longer unit than a sentence. It's a set of sentences that are well-organized and coherent, and they're all about the same thing. Several sentences often make up a paragraph.</p>
    <section>The first sentence of your paragraph should offer the reader an idea of the type of information they may expect to find when they read the rest. The initial sentences should construct a scenario that will set the tone for the rest of the sentence.  And the rest of the sentence should strive to maintain the same theme.</section>
    <br>
    <strong>its a great day</strong>
    <p>The essential sentences in the paragraph should be supplemented by the middle sentence. You can use this middle sentence to persuade the reader of the main point you made in the beginning. Expand every detail so the viewers can perceive everything from your point of view.</p>
